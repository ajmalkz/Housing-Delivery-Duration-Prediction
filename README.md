# 🏠 Housing Delivery Duration Prediction

This project predicts **delivery durations (in minutes)** for housing-related package deliveries using historical data and a **Linear Regression** model.

## 🚀 Goal

Estimate delivery durations using historical delivery data, helping businesses:

* Improve delivery planning.
* Communicate accurate delivery ETAs to customers.
* Optimize resource allocation.

## 🛠️ Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd housing-delivery-duration
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Add your dataset**:
   Place your delivery dataset as:

   ```
   data/housing.csv
   ```

---

## ⚙️ Running the Pipeline

Run the full end-to-end machine learning pipeline:

```bash
python -m src.main
```

This will:

* Load and clean data from `housing.csv`
* Engineer features and target variable
* Train a Linear Regression model
* Predict delivery durations
* Evaluate model performance
* Save outputs to the `outputs/` folder

---

## 📈 Outputs

* `models/linear_regression.pkl`: Trained ML model
* `outputs/predictions.csv`: Actual vs Predicted delivery durations
* `outputs/evaluation.txt`: Evaluation metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE)

---

## 🖥️ Streamlit Web App

Launch the web interface to upload a CSV and get predictions:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Features:

* Upload a CSV file
* Run predictions using the trained model
* View results in a table
* Download predicted durations as CSV

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

Stored in `outputs/evaluation.txt`:

* **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)** – average error in minutes
* **MSE (Mean Squared Error)** – penalizes larger errors
* **RMSE (Root MSE)** – in same units as target, sensitive to large errors

## 💡 How It Works

1. Historical delivery data is cleaned and processed.
2. Features like order time, item count, and partner availability are extracted.
3. The Linear Regression model learns patterns in delivery behavior.
4. The model is used to predict delivery duration for new orders.
